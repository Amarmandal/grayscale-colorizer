# grayscale-colorizer
Convert the grayscale image into it's RGB equivalent.

This is a project of Image colorization where we add colors to a grayscale picture by using a special class of convolutional neural networks (CNN) called autoencoders. These neural networks are able to distill the salient features of an image, and then regenerate the image based on these learned features.

â€‹Image colorization often requires a large amount of human effort, time and skill but this type of deep learning architecture has made this task quite easy. It is used to increase the visual appeal of images such as old black and white photos, classic movies, and scientific visualizations.
